	Note: 
		# If you want to change the status of a loan from "pending" to "done", 
	instead of changing it here, you should change all of its installment's status to done and the system will automatically change the status of the loan to "done".
		# After creating a loan, the system will automatically create installments according to the duration of the loan. So if the number of the duration is too high,
	it may take time for the system to create all installments.
		# Please minimize the change of information here because, after each change, the system will "renew" all of its installments, fines, and related messages.
